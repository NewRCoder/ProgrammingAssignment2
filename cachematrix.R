## Caching the Inverse of a Matrix.
##
## Since calculating the inverse of a matrix is an expensive computation, there are 
## advantages to caching the inverse of a matrix rather that computing it repeatedly.
##
## The two functions namely; makeCacheMatrix and cacheSolve create a special "matrix"
## object and compute the inverse of the matrix respectively. 

## The makeCacheMatrix function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse. 

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
    i <- NULL
    set <- function(y) {
        x <<- y
        i <<- NULL
    }
    get <- function() x
    setinverse <- function(solve) i <<- solve
    getinverse <- function() i
    list(set = set, get = get, setinverse = setinverse, getinverse = getinverse)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the 
## cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
    ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
    i <- x$getinverse()
    if(!is.null(i)) {
        message("getting cached data")
        return(i)
    }
    data <- x$get()
    i <- solve(data, ...)
    x$setinverse(i)
    i
}
